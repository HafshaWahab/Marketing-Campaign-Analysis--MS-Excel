## Background of Project 
The project is a marketing campaign analysis of a store, conducted by a data analyst for Maven Marketing. It includes data from 2,240 customers, covering customer profiles, product preferences, campaign outcomes, and channel performance metrics. The analysis aims to uncover actionable insights for future marketing strategies and optimize campaign effectiveness.

## Goals & KPIs
The primary goal is to inform future marketing strategies and optimize campaign effectiveness. Key performance indicators (KPIs) include understanding customer demographics, identifying successful marketing campaigns, and analysing web purchases to expand online marketing and build a strong customer base.

## Findings
1)	As a data analyst, I am asked to identify null values and outliers. And it has been seen that there are 24 null values in the income section. These null values can be treated in various ways:
-	We can drop the null value records if the number of null values is insignificant and would not affect our data analysis.
-	Otherwise, we can also find the mean, median, mode or regression income values under different categories and fill up those null values.
-	Finally, I treated the null values by taking the mean of the income of different groups of people based on their marital status and educational qualification.
2)	Some of the important factors that we can consider in web purchases include customers' demographics- Age, Education, Marital Status, and Country.
3)	As per the analysis, it can be seen that maximum of our customers are Spanish married couples, born between 1963-1982, with Graduation degree and their income ranges between 26,730 - 76,729.
4)	The best-selling product is wine, followed by meat products.
5)	The best-performing channel is Store, whereas, the most underperforming channel is deal purchases.
6)	The company has performed best in its 4th campaign.

## Recommendations to Client
1)	The client is advised to further investigate the strategies of the most successful campaign and replicate them in starting campaigns.
2)	Additionally, the client is encouraged to focus on web purchases to expand online marketing and focus on building a strong customer base.
